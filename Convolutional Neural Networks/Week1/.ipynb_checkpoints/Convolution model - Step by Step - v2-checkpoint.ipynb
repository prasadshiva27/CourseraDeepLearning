    "Welcome to Course 4's first assignment! In this assignment, you will implement convolutional (CONV) and pooling (POOL) layers in numpy, including both forward propagation and (optionally) backward propagation. \n",

    "**Notation**:\n",
    "- Superscript $[l]$ denotes an object of the $l^{th}$ layer. \n",
    "    - Example: $a^{[4]}$ is the $4^{th}$ layer activation. $W^{[5]}$ and $b^{[5]}$ are the $5^{th}$ layer parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Superscript $(i)$ denotes an object from the $i^{th}$ example. \n",
    "    - Example: $x^{(i)}$ is the $i^{th}$ training example input.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Lowerscript $i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ entry of a vector.\n",
    "    - Example: $a^{[l]}_i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ entry of the activations in layer $l$, assuming this is a fully connected (FC) layer.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- $n_H$, $n_W$ and $n_C$ denote respectively the height, width and number of channels of a given layer. If you want to reference a specific layer $l$, you can also write $n_H^{[l]}$, $n_W^{[l]}$, $n_C^{[l]}$. \n",
    "- $n_{H_{prev}}$, $n_{W_{prev}}$ and $n_{C_{prev}}$ denote respectively the height, width and number of channels of the previous layer. If referencing a specific layer $l$, this could also be denoted $n_H^{[l-1]}$, $n_W^{[l-1]}$, $n_C^{[l-1]}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that you are already familiar with `numpy` and/or have completed the previous courses of the specialization. Let's get started!"
